============

**Dark Cerberus** is a ~~dark theme and~~ Safari extension for the [Cerb](http://www.cerb6.com) CRM.

It began as a dark theme. Now it has other neat tricks, too, like basic tag highlighting. One day, it will take over the planet.

* JS performance was made twice as fast (then slowed down again with new features)
* FIXED: columns with multi-level cells were improperly tagged
